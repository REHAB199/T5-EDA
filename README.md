The goal of this project was to EDA to thinking about While many parameters influence a car buyer, the decision always involves emotion. The first thing to consider before taking any decision is to have as much good quality data as possible. We have then to perform analysis and extract information's.
In this EDA project , I'll study a public dataset available on KAGGLE. The dataset is scraped from Craiglist, a very popular classified ads in the US, and north America. It contains information's from around 450k car classified ads observation and 26 columns.
